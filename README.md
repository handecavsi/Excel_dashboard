- The following steps were carried out in the project, respectively:

1. The Excel Data sheet contains data for a supermarket chain.
2. Correcting the date format to the desired format.
3. Separating the relevant sales date information by adding two new columns (month and year) to this data set.
4. The ship_mode and order_location tables contain additional information about the relevant sales. Bringing this data to the data sheet.

- Extracting Insight
1. In which year was the most profit made? (profit)
2. Which month has the most profit in the year with the highest profit?
3. Which country has the most orders numerically?
4. Which product category has the highest shipping_cost per unit for 2012?
5. Which customer group received the highest discount on average in 2013? 0 percent discounts should not be included.

- Visualization
Creating a dashboard after the necessary corrections and calculations.
Dashboard was created by determining important metrics, chart types are compatible with the data. Slicer and timeline were used. Visualizations were made on the map.

- Report
Recommendations were made based on the calculations and results. The aim of the report is how the company can increase its profits.

Dashboard consists of 4 stages:

1. General Order Report
2. Order Report by Country
3. Customer Segment Based Order report
4. Product Based order report

Since the Excel file size is above the Github limit, only dashboard images have been added to the repo. You can access the relevant Excel document and the video explanation of the project from the drive link.
